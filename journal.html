In class, I figured out how to make the counter project in Scratch. Every multiple of 3 is Fizz, 5 is Buzz and 15 is FizzBuzz. To make sure that Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz did not all show up (I only wanted FizzBuzz) when the counter reached a multiple of 15, I made it so that when the counter reached a number and it was divisible by 3 with no remainder and divisible by 5 with a remainder, it would say Fizz. This makes it so that it will not say Fizz on multiples of 15 because when a multiple of 15 is divided by 5, it will have no remainder which doesnâ€™t fit the criteria mentioned above. For Buzz the same thing was done except with numbers divisible by 5 without a remainder and numbers divisible by 3 with a remainder above 0.

I just read the Javascript for Cats website and it explains the basics of Javascript pretty well. I think that by class tomorrow or after class tomorrow, I will have a good fundamental understanding of Javascript.
