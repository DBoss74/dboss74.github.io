        In class, I figured out how to make the counter project in Scratch. Every multiple of 3 is Fizz, 5 is Buzz and 15 is FizzBuzz. To make sure that Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz did not all show up (I only wanted FizzBuzz) when the counter reached a multiple of 15, I made it so that when the counter reached a number and it was divisible by 3 with no remainder and divisible by 5 with a remainder, it would say Fizz. This makes it so that it will not say Fizz on multiples of 15 because when a multiple of 15 is divided by 5, it will have no remainder which doesnâ€™t fit the criteria mentioned above. For Buzz the same thing was done except with numbers divisible by 5 without a remainder and numbers divisible by 3 with a remainder above 0.

        I just read the Javascript for Cats website and it explains the basics of Javascript pretty well. I think that by class tomorrow or after class tomorrow, I will have a good fundamental understanding of Javascript.

    	My website which had random swarming crabs is now complete and on my website. I am about to make another one with a different animal. I can choose how many animals I want on the screen and I made their locations randomly change every 100 milaseconds so it looks like they are bouncing around. The random crab website works like this: Each crab is in a class which is styled with a size and image (a crab div). Then, I have a function called "makeCrabs" which creates elements (divs). I also have a variable called "clear", so when I add an event listener ("click"), and click the clear div on the screen, the crab's opacity = 0, making it disapear. I have another function called "time" and inside that I have crab.style which moves the crabs a random amount of pixels every time I reload the page. I set the time interval to 100 milaseconds, so now the crabs automatically change location every 100 milaseconds. For the function "makeCrabs", I set the amount of crabs to 100. All of this together makes a website with 100 crabs randomly moving every 100 milaseconds, with a "clear" div that you can click on which makes all the crabs invisable.

    	I am adding a link on my baseball field that leads to my racecar game. This game was made by me and Spencer in scratch using the makey-make devices. We wired up the makey-makeys so that they are controllers which determine how your respective racecar moves.
